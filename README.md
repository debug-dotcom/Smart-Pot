  This file describes about my project **"SMART POT"** done during my Semesters. 
  
  ## Abstract:
        
        IoT is everywhere in todayâ€™s world, from food industry to healthcare. So, we formulated an idea to implement IoT in a simple and efficient way on plant pots. Gardeners want to grow healthy plants but maintaining plants in pots requires lot of time and patience. Smile pot helps people to get connected to their plants. 
        Smile pot has a super-intelligent monitoring system that helps to understand plants condition and update the user with emoji. Normal pots have no data monitoring system, this give smile pot a huge advantage as data about the plant such as humidity, moisture level, health of the plant can be monitored often and used for future analysis. Even the user can set regular watering session for the plant based on its need. 
        The auto watering system helps to water plants when the moisture level is below par. Overwatering is a major drawback of using pot, smile pot even helps us to track water level in soil and water plant only when needed. Pretty much anything with roots can grow in smart pot. This method encourages lot of urban residents to engage with plants and create their own organic food. Thus, smile pot reduces undernourishment and helps to create a better chemical free food supply.
