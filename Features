    feeding them, playing with them and generally taking time out of your otherwise busy life to make sure they stayed in good health. With this sensor- packed plant 
    pot, you must do the same for your house plant. A 0.96-inch OLED screen on the front displays a simple emoji face that changes according to the needs of the plant. 
    It will show a sad face when soil moisture drops under a defined threshold, a happy face if you’re watering it, a neutral face if it’s getting enough light, and so 
    on. These animations result from data gathered by soil moisture sensor and displayed in OLED screen. It looks like a fun and modern way to care for your house 
    plants.
