Objective:

In this project, we have created a sensible plant pot that will show the emotions of a plant. It uses a moisture sensing element to track 
the wetness in soil and it shows an emotional expression for each level of wetness. As we all know that plant requires water to be alive 
and it’s like food to them, unfairly sometimes we are unaware of water plants according to their need. Therefore, we can say it’s fairly a 
smart pot that predicts the wetness of the soil and displays in an OLED as Emojis. It’s a significant project to create a sensible plant 
pot and visually monitor the wetness level within the pot using Emoji.
